# NeRF-Homework
This is the NeRF homework for the IBIO4615 course.
## General Overview
First of all you will be running the [NeRF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08934.pdf) architecture, after completing certain parts of the code. Then, you will be running a pretrained [D-NeRF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02268.pdf) architecture for a predetermined dataset. We expect you to complete these tasks in order and answer the questions in the report in the respective order as well. For the report please use the text editor and the column formatting of your preference. When uploading it, please do it as a PDF with the following name: 'lastname_NeRF_code'. All of these methods are very recent so we expect you to have a lot of fun and learn a lot using them !
